	<h4>Overview</h4>
	<p>Donald Trump is the Republican Candidate for the 2016 Presidential Election. Mr. Trump is known as one of the most successful business owners in America due to the booming wealth that he has acquired since he started his first business. As of October 3rd, his main opponent, Hillary Clinton, is leading the polls by 6%. Despite the polls, Trump is very popular because of his previous success in business and his powerful and strong demeanor. Unfortunately for him, this demeanor also scares off a lot voters because he is known for being too rash and not thinking things through properly.</p>
	<h4>Beliefs<h4>
	<p>Mr. Trump has clearly stated that he plans on building a wall on the border between Mexico and North America. Though the Mexican citizens and leaders refuse to pay for the wall, Trump insists that they will. Mr. Trump also believes that there should be no Syrian Refugees or Muslim people permitted to enter the country. These could cause conflict with other countries, but many American people belive that this is the right way to go. Mr. Trump has not been clear about his views on abortion or other controversial topics.</p>
	<h4>Lawsuits and Scandals<h4>
	<p>Mr. Trump has been engaged in a number of lawsuits, most of which have been settled in his favor, over the many years that he has been a business over. His scandals, however, mostly remain unresolved. For example, the infamous Trump University is under major investigation for its legitimacy. Another scandal is the proposal that the Trump Foundation, Trump's primary charity, has been funding the bills for lawsuits and portraits of Mr. Trump. This is still under pending investigation. In the past, Trump has been involved with many lawsuits that deal with racial-bias, to which Mr. Trump replied with, "I am the least racist person in America." </p>
